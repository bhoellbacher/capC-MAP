1.   capC-MAP requires the Biopython Python package. How do I get that?

     Biopython can be downloaded from https://biopython.org/wiki/Download
     but the easiest way to install it is via pip

     ::

	pip install biopython

     or if you don't have root privileges

     ::

	pip install --user biopython
