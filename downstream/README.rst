capC-MAP : Analysis software for Capture-C data
***********************************************

Examples of downstream data analysis
====================================

This directory contains a set of tutorials for downstream analysis of
interaction profiles generated by capC-MAP. It also contains some example
data which was obtained from GEO:GSE120666.

The tutorials are given in html, pdf and R markdown formats, and are as follows:

*R_analysis*
   a set of scripts in R (using various common packages) which will plot mapping statistics, "per-target" statistics and interaction profiles from capC-MAP output.

*python_analysis*
   as above, but using Python and common command line tools (bedtools).

*file_conversion*
   some example command lines of how to convert the bedGraph output from capC-MAP into other formats (BigWig and variableStep wiggle formats)

*peakC*
   an example of how to use the peakC software [*]_ to call peaks from interaction profiles generated by capC-MAP.


.. [*] The peakC software is available at https://github.com/deWitLab/peakC, and is detailed 
   in the paper Geeven, G., Teunissen, H., de Laat, W., and de Wit, E. "peakC: a flexible, 
   non-parametric peak calling package for 4C and Capture-C data" *Nucleic acids research* **46** 
   (2018) e91 
   which is available at https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gky443
